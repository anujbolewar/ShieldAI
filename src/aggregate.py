SHIELD AI — Phase 1: Stream Unification (The Aggregator)
=========================================================

Reads factory streams from ingest.py and:
    1. Auto-tags each row with its factory_id (already embedded in factory CSVs).
    2. Concatenates all factory tables into one unified Industrial Discharge Stream.

The Industrial Discharge Stream is the single Pathway table consumed by
backtrack.py for the temporal join step.
